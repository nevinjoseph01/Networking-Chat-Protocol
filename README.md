# Networking-Chat-Protocol
SIMP, short for Simple IMC Messaging Protocol, is a streamlined chat protocol that uses UDP. It ensures reliable communication through features like a three-way handshake, stop-and-wait messaging, and clearly structured headers. Built for two-user communication, SIMP relies on a client-daemon setup to efficiently handle chat sessions.
